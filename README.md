# Pull Request Template Repository

This is a repository showing a pull request template covering my own best practices. That I try to explain on [this article](https://medium.com/@pabloadell/5-things-every-pull-request-should-be-little-thoughts-from-my-experience-14bdb01d827e).

- Adding graphic support when needed
- Explaninig yourself (through context and goal sections)
- Remember testing is needed

## Here there is an example on how the template will look like:
